# 🚗 Bike & Car Entry-Exit Counter using YOLOv8 + OpenCV

""" This repository is for a computer vision-based project that detects and tracks bikes and cars using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. It draws bounding boxes around the detected vehicles and counts how many bikes or cars cross a defined area (entry/exit zone) in a video feed or CCTV footage """

# 📌 Features

Real-time object detection for bikes and cars

Creates bounding boxes around detected vehicles

Defines a custom zone or line for counting

Counts how many vehicles enter or exit the area

Frame-by-frame tracking and display using OpenCV

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

OpenCV

NumPy

Shapely (for zone detection)

Torch (PyTorch backend)

# 🎯 Use Case
